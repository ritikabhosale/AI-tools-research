# Impacts of ChatGPT - Microsoft Report

- **Microsoft Report** revealed that over 80 percent of Indian workers are ready to delegate as much work as possible to AI in order to lessen their workloads.

- Also, the boom in generative artificial intelligence has prompted intense speculation about the long-term repercussions of this cutting-edge technology across industries and activities.

- The major threats of artificial intelligence include the `spread of misinformation, privacy violations and unemployment.` The biggest cause of concern for governments around the world is that generative AI could replace tens of millions of jobs.

- Now according to a Microsoft report, `74 percent of Indian workers are worried that AI will replace their jobs`. The US tech giant released its ‘Work Trend Index 2023’ report recently. The Microsoft Work Trend Index 2023 surveys employees and leaders across industries in 31 countries.

# From the point of jobs, let us look at the two sides of the story:

## The companies

- Every company is trying to understand what could be its scope and play in this new technology even as generative AI takes artificial intelligence mainstream faster than many had thought would be possible.

- Bill Gates, in his recent article, **“The Age of AI has Begun”**, spoke about the possibilities this can have to reduce the world’s worst inequities — be it in healthcare, education or other areas.

- Accenture’s recent report, **“A new era of generative AI for everyone”**, has stressed on the need for companies to develop a strong digital core and to make investments in people as they unlock the value in a responsible way.

- The report said that **98% of global executives** believe that AI foundation models would play an important role in their organisations over the next 3-5 years; `and that 40% of working hours could be impacted by large language models such as GPT-4.`

## The jobseekers

- Multiple reports today boldly state which jobs are going to be at risk due to the advent of GPT-4 and other generative AI tools. Yes, these tools can write, code, create images and answer questions — all in a fraction of seconds.

- The use cases are still emerging and will get contextualised further. While many work streams could see real productivity benefits with the use of these tools, we will definitely see more human-machine collaboration than competition in the short-to-medium term.

- For example, GPT-4 can generate an article with a prompt. A human might still need to edit it, add more context and then finalise it for use. Indeed, `there could be issues with accuracy if we depend only on these tools.` Besides, if companies and people start using such tools indiscriminately, the resulting `solutions will start resembling each other instead of being unique and different.` So what it means for aspiring and current employees is the need to keep upskilling themselves to become better at what they do.

- Keep building the peer network of learning and support and keep oneself updated about the new changes in technology and how it is getting used.

- `Being able to ask questions, solve problems, collaborate, communicate and have deep functional skills will remain critical for most white-collar jobs.` As will human creativity. Maybe generative AI will be a coworker for many of us.
