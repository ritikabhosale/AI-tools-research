## Impacts on environment

- According to Stanford’s Artificial Intelligence Index, it took the equivalent of 502 tons of carbon dioxide emissions to train GPT-3 last year

- ChatGPT could emit about 3.8 tons of CO2e every single day!

- It is equivalent to enough energy to power an average U.S. home for over 120 years to train the model.

- Researchers have estimated that Google uses as much electricity yearly in developing its AI as every home in a city the size of Atlanta.

- The new, yet-to-be peer-reviewed research, posted as a pre-print in arXiv, estimates that a conversation of about 20-50 questions with the AI chatbot in a single system may “drink” a “500ml bottle of water”.

- A framework to estimate the amount of clean freshwater consumed for generating electricity to power data centre servers and for cooling servers to run AI models was developed for the research.
Citing an example, scientists said that in training GPT-3 alone, Microsoft may have consumed a stunning 700,000 litres (185,000 gallons) of water – enough to produce 370 BMW cars.

- The tech giant has partnered with ChatGPT creator OpenAI and invested $10bn in the company.
Other AI models like Google’s LaMDA can consume a “stunning” amount of water in the order of millions of litres, scientists noted.

- “AI models can, and also should, take social responsibility and lead by example in the collective efforts to combat the global water scarcity challenge by cutting their own water footprint,” scientists wrote in the study

“While a 500ml bottle of water might not seem too much, the total combined water footprint for inference is still extremely large, considering ChatGPT’s billions of users,” they said.
Researchers said these numbers may increase by “multiple times” for the newly-launched GPT-4 AI system which has a larger model size.

- Rapid progress in AI is arousing fear as well as excitement. How worried should you be?

- Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop non-human minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart...and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilisation?” These questions were asked last month in an open letter from the Future of Life Institute, an ngo. It called for a six-month “pause” in the creation of the most advanced forms of artificial intelligence (ai), and was signed by tech luminaries including Elon Musk. It is the most prominent example yet of how rapid progress in ai has sparked anxiety about the potential dangers of the technology.
